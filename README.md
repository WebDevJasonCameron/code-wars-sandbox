# code_wars_sandbox

## 2022 03 15 | Acknowledgments
This is a place where I can work on my responses to the code war challenges.  When I first heard about code-wars, I cringed at the idea of showing off how bad I am at coming to solutions on problems.  I never liked competitive puzzle challenges.  That is ironic, because I truly know how competitive I can be.  Perhaps it is that competitiveness that wars with my concern with not being able to be the best in those witty challenges that cause me to steer clear from public interactions on games of wit and intelligence. Despite this personal observation, I am on an internal (yet public) soul-journey through these coding challenges.  I expect much like the rub-ix cube I had as a child, I will inevitably seek to peel the sticker off and restart somewhere along the way.  Yet, I have to say that even that was a revelation into how my own mind works.  So... I'll take that as a win for self awareness (if nothing else).
